# Hi, I'm Aarush, and I'm a highschooler interested in a bunch of stuff:

## Math: Euclidean geometry/ competitive calculus

## Computer Science: competitive programming/ computer vision/ LaTeX

## Physics: interesting mechanics problems/ Hawking's many theories of black holes

## Whatever else requires a problem to solve!
